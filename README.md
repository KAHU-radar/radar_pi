This would be a pretty useless plugin if OpenCPN did not exist. Hurrah for @bdbcat!

The plugin was started by @cowelld, who took @bdbcat's Garmin radar plugin and the reverse engineered data from http://www.roboat.at/technologie/radar/ and created the first working version in 2012.

@canboat started helping Dave. Soon he implemented most of the 4G specific functionality, refactored the code, rewrote the control dialogs, implemented the guard zones, target trails, PPI windows, EBL/VRM and mouse cursor functionality.

@nohal contributed the packaging installers, without which this would still be a set of sources instead of deliverable packages for various platforms.

@Hakansv did a lot of testing and contributed the idle timer, and coordinated work on the translations.

@douwefokkema also tested a lot and implemented the heading on radar functionality, optimised the OpenGL drawing, implemented the refresh rate code and optimised the target trails code. Douwe also made the MARPA and ARPA functionality.

@seandepagnier wrote initial shader support, challenged us to improve the code and wrote some optimizations.
